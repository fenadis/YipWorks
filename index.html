                        "The developers from YipWorks built us a maintenance tracking system that's simple but powerful. 
                        It keeps our vendors accountable and tenants happy. Their turnaround time was impressive, 
                        and costs were very reasonable."

                        Their team was responsive, understood our needs, and delivered a dashboard that 
                        finally gives me real-time visibility into rent payments and lease expirations."

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At YipWorks, we believe businesses shouldn't have to choose between overpriced agencies 
                and unreliable freelancers. That's why we built a different kind of development team — 
                one that helps both sides win. We connect talented computer science students and recent 
                grads with businesses that need affordable, reliable software solutions. Our developers 
                gain real-world experience working on meaningful projects, and our clients get high-quality 
                results without the overhead, delays, or bloated pricing of traditional firms. Whether you 
                need a custom dashboard, internal automation, or a full web app — we deliver clean, practical 
                software with a fast turnaround and a personal touch.

            <h2>A Message From the Founder</h2>
            <div class="founder-message">
                <img src="./images/image.png" alt="Founder Alex Yip" class="founder-photo">
                <p>
                    I started YipWorks after graduating from the University of Southern California. 
                    Like many new grads, I saw firsthand how tough it was for smart, capable students 
                    to break into the tech industry. Some of the best developers I knew were overlooked, 
                    not because they weren't qualified, but because they didn't fit neatly into a hiring pipeline. 
                    YipWorks began as a way to change that — to give those peers a real chance to build and 
                    grow through real client work. What started as a side project to help friends has grown 
                    into something bigger: a way to support emerging developers while delivering results that 
                    businesses can truly rely on.
