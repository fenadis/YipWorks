                        It keeps our vendors accountable and tenants happy. Their turnaround time was impressive, 
                        and costs were very reasonable."

                        finally gives me real-time visibility into rent payments and lease expirations."

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At YipWorks, we believe businesses shouldn't have to choose between overpriced agencies 
                and unreliable freelancers. That's why we built a different kind of development team — 
                one that helps both sides win. We connect talented computer science students and recent 
                grads with businesses that need affordable, reliable software solutions. Our developers 
                gain real-world experience working on meaningful projects, and our clients get high-quality 
                results without the overhead, delays, or bloated pricing of traditional firms. Whether you 
                need a custom dashboard, internal automation, or a full web app — we deliver clean, practical 
                software with a fast turnaround and a personal touch.

            <h2>A Message From the Founder</h2>
            <div class="founder-message">
                <img src="./images/image.png" alt="Founder Alex Yip" class="founder-photo">
                <p>
                    I started YipWorks after graduating from the University of Southern California. 
                    Like many new grads, I saw firsthand how tough it was for smart, capable students 
                    to break into the tech industry. Some of the best developers I knew were overlooked, 
                    not because they weren't qualified, but because they didn't fit neatly into a hiring pipeline. 
                    YipWorks began as a way to change that — to give those peers a real chance to build and 
                    grow through real client work. What started as a side project to help friends has grown 
                    into something bigger: a way to support emerging developers while delivering results that 
                    businesses can truly rely on.
